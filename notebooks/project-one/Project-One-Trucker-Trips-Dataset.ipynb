    "If you've ever been on the road, you've likely seen a truck. These massive tractor-trailers play a vital role in the U.S. economy, transporting an astounding 11.46 billion tons of freight each year. In fact, the trucking industry is valued at a staggering $2.2 trillion. To maintain efficiency in delivering goods from manufacturers to stores, companies rely on advanced routing algorithms to optimize their operations."

    "To find how current routes are for truck drivers, we'll be using the [delivery truck trips dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ramakrishnanthiyagu/delivery-truck-trips-data/data). It will assess how efficient their eta prediction is and the potential delays surrounding it. Some necessary questions about the dataset: \n",
    "- Whatâ€™s the comparison between planned eta and actual eta? \n",
    "- Do long hours cause fatigue to the driver, and/or is more time driving likely for a delay?\n",
    "- Do certain customers have higher delay rates?\n",
    "- Are any GPS Providers causing delays?"

    "Some takeaways from the data gathered:\n",
    "- Only a little over 1/3rd of the time is the ETA accurate and even less if early is considered inaccurate.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- There's a correlation between delays and how long the driver is driving. This is to be expected, as the longer a trip takes the more likely for unexpected events to occur, which increases delay. There is also the factor that a delay increases the time driving too.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Customers seem to experience the same amount of delay as everyone else, except for Dacima India.\n",
    "\n",
    "- No real correlation could be made if Market and Regular have an impact on delays. This is surprising since I thought there would be a correlation. Especially if I have a contract with a company, I would expect to get it on time to ensure a good relationship, but perhaps it's not as important.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The GPS Providers Consent Track and Vamosys, the two most represented companies in the data set have polar opposite representations for their accuracy. Consent Track does a very poor job at giving good times with a whopping 12.7% accuracy rate compared to Vamosys with an 87.2% accuracy. There is a chance that maybe Vamosys overcorrects which leads to many <i>early</i> status, but more information would have to be provided.\n",

    "I think mostly all the questions I asked were answered. I do wish I knew how to map the pinged locations to create a visual map, but I had issues with seaborn/matplotlib and visualizing it to be comprehensible. It also doesn't help that the pinged location wasn't in predictable times and there were very few rows with the same people. \n",

    "As the data has shown, delays are very frequent for truck drivers. We don't have 100% proof as to why these delays happen, but it can be some fault that can be attributed to GPS Providers or the length of time deliveries are. More research will have to be done on these GPS Providers to verify that these findings are true. Specifically, how much padding is being given for delays and how are they training to find these times? There is also the chance that I'm not using enough data for Vamosys as it's only ~500 rows of data. Overall, because I paint Vamosys in a better light than Count Track, fewer people will use Count Track which will significantly affect the company. "
